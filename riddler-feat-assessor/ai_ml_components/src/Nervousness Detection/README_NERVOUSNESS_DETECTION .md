# Nervousness_Detection

## Overview
Nervousness Detection is a project aimed at identifying and analyzing signs of nervousness in individuals through various machine learning techniques. This project leverages a dataset of confident and unconfident individuals to train models that can predict nervousness based on various input features.

## Methodology
The project employs a combination of data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning algorithms to detect nervousness. The steps involved include:
1. **Data Collection:** Using the dataset of confident and unconfident individuals.
2. **Feature Engineering:** Extracting relevant features that can help in detecting nervousness.
3. **Model Training:** Training machine learning models on the preprocessed data.
4. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluating the performance of the models using appropriate metrics.
5. **Deployment:** Deploying the best-performing model for real-time nervousness detection.

## Business Segment
This project will be used in the Riddler-Bias-Zero segment, focusing on applications that require an understanding of human emotions and behaviors to reduce biases and improve decision-making processes.
